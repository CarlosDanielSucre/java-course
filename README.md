## Sequential Structure

A **Sequential Structure** is the most fundamental type of control flow in programming.  
In Java, this means that each instruction is executed **in the exact order** it appears — one after another — **without any conditionals or loops**.
This is the most basic control structure and is fundamental to understanding program flow.

### Key Concepts:
- No decision-making (`if`, `switch`)
- No repetition structures (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)
- Code is executed **line by line**, from top to bottom

### ☕ Java Example:
In the example below, each comand is executed one after the other, in the order they are written:
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Starting program...");
        System.out.println("Loading data...");
        System.out.println("Processing...");
        System.out.println("Done!");
    }
}

```

## Estrutura Condicional

Conditional structures allow the program to **make decisions** using statements like `if`, `else`, and `switch`.  
These are essential when different behaviors are needed based on input or state.

---

## Estruturas Repetitivas

Java provides several **looping mechanisms** such as `for`, `while`, and `do-while`, which are used to execute a block of code **multiple times**.  
They are powerful for automation, iteration, and data processing.

## Outros Tópicos Básicos sobre Java

Here we cover foundational Java elements like:
- Variable declarations
- Operators and expressions
- Input/output with `Scanner`
- Type casting
- Standard Java libraries

---

## Introdução à Programação Orientada a Objetos

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) introduces concepts like **classes**, **objects**, and **methods**.  
Java is an OOP language, and understanding these principles is key to building modular and reusable code.

---

## Construtores, palavra `this`, Sobrecarga e Encapsulamento

This module explores:
- **Constructors**: special methods to initialize objects
- **`this` keyword**: refers to the current object
- **Method overloading**: using the same method name with different parameters
- **Encapsulation**: protecting data through access modifiers and getters/setters

---

## Trabalhar com Data e Hora

Java provides the `java.time` package for working with **dates and times** efficiently.  
Learn how to:
- Get current date/time
- Format and parse dates
- Use `LocalDate`, `LocalTime`, and `LocalDateTime`

---

## Enumerações e Composições

- **Enums**: define a fixed set of constants, useful for readable code and decision-making.
- **Composition**: modeling complex types by combining simpler classes.  
It's an alternative to inheritance and a key part of clean object modeling.
